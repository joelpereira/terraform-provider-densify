# densify Provider

Retrieve right-sizing optimizations directly from the Densify API for cloud and/or container resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    densify = {
      source = "densify.com/provider/densify"
    }
  }
}

# Configuration-based authentication
provider "densify" {
  densify_instance = "<instance>.densify.com:8443" # or can be passed in as env variable: DENSIFY_INSTANCE
  username         = "username"                    # or can be passed in as env variable: DENSIFY_USERNAME
  password         = "password"                    # or can be passed in as env variable: DENSIFY_PASSWORD
  tech_platform    = "aws"                         # or can be passed in as env variable: DENSIFY_TECH_PLATFORM
  account_number   = "account-num"
  system_name      = "system-name"
}
data "densify_cloud" "optimization" {}

# output the Densify data source for validation
output "data_cloud" {
  value = data.densify_cloud.optimization
}
